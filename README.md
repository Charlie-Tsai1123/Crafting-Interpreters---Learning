# Crafting Interpreters – Lox Interpreter Implementation and Learning

This repository contains my implementation of an interpreter for the **Lox programming language**, following the book  
[Crafting Interpreters_ by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The purpose of this project is to deeply understand how interpreters and programming languages work, including **lexing, parsing, abstract syntax trees, evaluation, and runtime error handling**.

## 📘 About the Book

**Crafting Interpreters** is a well-known book that teaches how to build a programming language by getting your hands dirty.  
It introduces two implementations of Lox:

- **jlox** – a tree-walk interpreter written in Java  
- **clox** – a bytecode VM written in C

## Disclaimer

This project is an educational implementation based on the book  
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

The design and structure of the interpreter closely follow the book.
This repository is intended solely for learning and academic purposes.
